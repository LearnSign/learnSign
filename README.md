# LearnSign

63 million people identify as deaf or hard of hearing in India. Accessibility has always been a huge problem to learn sign language.
The best time to learn a language is as a child, so we aim to target teaching sign language at the root. 

Our app, learnSign, is a gamified, e-learning app focused on teaching small children sign language.
learnSign uses artificial intelligence to provide instant feedback on hand sign technique and augmented reality for an interactive and kinesthetic learning experience.

##Major Features

###Lessons & Quizzes
The student can learn through our lessons and test their skills with our quizzes. The lessons are easy to understand and the learner can learn kinesthetically with augmented reality. The quizzes use machine learning to detect the signs and provide real-time feedback.

###Friends & LeaderBoard
We wanted to make sure you can interact and practice with your friends through video call. We believe that socializing and friends is a part of what makes learning fun. The leaderboard is a competitive aspect to encourage children to do their very best.

###Badges & Prizes
We took into account that kids don't like traditional e-learning as they find it boring, so we gamified it. You can earn badges and prizes by completing lessons and quizzes

###Donate Cryptocurrency
To further develop and maintain our free app, we give the option for users to donate cryptocurrency, a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions, using a technology called blockchain.
